# Booking Module Tests

This directory contains test outputs and documentation for the booking module.

## Contents

- `TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing documentation
- `coverage_services.out` - Service layer coverage data (generated by tests)
- `coverage_services.html` - Service layer coverage report (generated by tests)
- `coverage_middleware.out` - Middleware coverage data (generated by tests)
- `coverage_middleware.html` - Middleware coverage report (generated by tests)

## Test Files Location

Test files are located alongside their corresponding source files:
- `../services/*_test.go` - Service layer tests
- `../middleware/*_test.go` - Middleware tests

## Running Tests

From the booking module root directory:

```bash
# Run all tests
./run_tests.sh

# Run specific test suite
go test -v ./services/...
go test -v ./middleware/...

# With coverage
go test -v ./services/... -coverprofile=tests/coverage_services.out
go tool cover -html=tests/coverage_services.out -o tests/coverage_services.html
```

## Coverage Reports

After running `./run_tests.sh`, open the HTML coverage reports:

```bash
open tests/coverage_services.html
open tests/coverage_middleware.html
```

## Test Organization

Tests follow Go conventions:
- Test files use `_test.go` suffix
- Tests are in the same package as the code they test
- This allows testing of both exported and unexported functions
- Coverage reports are output to this `tests/` directory for organization

See `TESTING.md` for comprehensive testing documentation.
